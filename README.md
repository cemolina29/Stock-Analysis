# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of project:

###### The purpose of these analysis is to be able to analyze an entire dataset and expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years by refactoring code for a dozen stocks, the purpose of refactoring the code is so that it takes a less time to execute.


## Results:

###### Below are the screenshots that show the run time for the refactored code of the analysis.

## Summary:

**What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?**
###### One of the greatest advantages of refactoring the code was that as a result the macro run time decreased. 

###### Disadvantages: I would not refactor a code unless is extremely needed.


**How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?**
###### While working on refactoring the code it definitely helped make the code run faster and have less data to go over and not so complex. There was a challenge that while trying to re-design the code I did have to think a lot on how to debug, find missing information and make the code work. A disanvantage would be that for bigger data file set I would find it difficult to refactor.
